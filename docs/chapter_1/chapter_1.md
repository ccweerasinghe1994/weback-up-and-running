# WEBPACK UP AND RUNNING

## The fundamentals of Webpack 5

Essentially, Webpack is a module bundler for JavaScript applications. Webpack takes a
series of JavaScript files, along with dependencies such as image files, which make up an
application, and constructs something called a dependency graph. A dependency graph is a
representation of how these files and dependencies are ordered and linked within an
application and shows how the files interact with each other.
